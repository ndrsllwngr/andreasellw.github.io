## First steps

Take a look at [https://www.rust-lang.org/learn](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn).

- Read _the book_ [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) to get an overview and solid understanding of the language.
- Alternatively do the [Rustlings course](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/) or follow [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/).
- Microsoft offers a 5 hr 31 min learning path to lay the foundation of knowledge you need to build programs in Rust. It is called [Take your first steps with Rust](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/rust-first-steps/).
- You know JavaScript and want to try Rust? Then start with [Rust for JavaScript peeps](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/rust-for-js-peeps) by yoshuawuyts.
- The Android team at Google also offers a four-day course called [Comprehensive Rust](https://github.com/google/comprehensive-rust).

Stay up-to-date by subscribing to the newsletter [This Week in Rust](https://this-week-in-rust.org/).

New to Rust and still need to decide what crates to use? Look at [stdx](https://github.com/brson/stdx) _- The missing batteries of Rust_.

## Grow

- Read the practical guide [Programming Rust, 2nd Edition](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust-2nd/9781492052586/). Experienced systems programmers will learn how to successfully bridge the gap between performance and safety using Rust.
- Read [Rust Atomics and Locks](https://marabos.nl/atomics/) by Mara Bos to gain a clear understanding of low-level concurrency. Youâ€™ll learn everything about atomics and memory ordering and how they're combined with basic operating system APIs to build common primitives like mutexes and condition variables.
- [Rust for Rustaceans](https://rust-for-rustaceans.com/) by Jon Gjengset covers everything you need to build and maintain larger code bases, write powerful and flexible applications and libraries, and confidently expand the scope and complexity.
- Keep the [cheats.rs](https://cheats.rs/) cheat sheet close.
- The recipes from [Rust Cookbook](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/) might be an easy reminder of how to accomplish common tasks.
